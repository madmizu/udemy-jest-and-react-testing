# Udemy: Learn best practices for testing your apps with Jest and React Testing Library!

## What you'll learn

- [x] Testing simple and complex React applications with React Testing Library
- [x] React Testing best Practices: how to test behavior instead of implementation
- [x] Making the most of Jest watch mode, including running only one file or test at a time
- [x] Common errors returned by Testing Library and how to correct them

## Description
React Testing Library has become an extremely popular option for testing React, and with good reason! This detailed, comprehensive course  provides a solid foundation for React app tests.

### Best Practices

React Testing Library is famously opinionated about testing best practices, and is written to encourage these best practices. This course teaches:

- testing behavior over testing implementation
- tests that interact with your app the way a user would
- finding elements by accessibility handles, to make sure your code is accessible as possible

### Broad range of testing examples

The course apps start very with very simple examples (clicking a button to change its color) and work up to progressively more complicated testing concepts, such as: 

- testing asynchronous page changes
- simulating data from a server using Mock Service Worker
- applying a context provider to a component when rendering

The course builds up to complex concepts gradually, in a way designed to support your learning and ensure your success.

### Practice your new skills

You will also have plenty of opportunities to practice what youâ€™ve learned. The course provides "code quizzes" while building the course projects, where you can apply what you learned and then watch a video to see the solution. The (optional) final section provides even more exercises to complete the second app and reinforce concepts from the course.

### Optional React lectures

Any significant React code covered in the course is isolated into separate lectures. Students have a choice: those who want to reinforce their React skills (or learn new ones!) can watch those lectures, while students who feel confident in their React skills can skip them.

### Supportive Instructor

The instructor has a proven track record of responding to course Q&A in a helpful and supportive way. She loves to engage with students, answer questions about course concepts, and help debug students' code for the course projects.

## Who this course is for:
- React coders who want to learn how to write functional tests for their apps
- React application engineers who want confidence that writing code doesn't break existing behavior (tests, for the win!)
